##### A set of tools to help patients redevelop hand movements.
#
#
##### What is it?
- Fun Activities to help patients develop skills
- Advanced motion technology to isolate muscles and nerves for best rehabilitation possible
- Gesture control for easy use and interactive UI

##### Background

In this year alone, 70,000 Canadians will be immobilized on a hospital bed for more than a month. Individuals who are in a state of rest for such a long duration will soon face the danger of muscle attrition. To combat this problem, my team and I created ReHackilation to help patients exercise muscle groups in the arm while recovering. Through the use of tailor-made games and our in-house Javascript hand detection API, users can exercise different muscle groups. The code for this service is in the Github Repo and all that is required is a leap motion. We hope to help bring people to a healthier state of life with ReHackilation.
